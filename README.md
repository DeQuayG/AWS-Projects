This repository includes code for my first AWS Project: 

Within this project I: 
- Create an IAM User 
- Assign the user permisions that allow them S3 Access
- Create an S3 Bucket 
- Upload an image to the S3 Bucket 

All of this is done using the AWS SDK for Python - Boto3, as well as Terraform!

Here is the accompanying blog post for this project:
